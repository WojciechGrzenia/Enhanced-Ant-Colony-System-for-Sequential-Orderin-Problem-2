# Enhanced-Ant-Colony-System-for-Sequential-Ordering-Problem-2
In 2014, as part of my master's thesis I tried to improve the Enhanced Ant Colony System for solving Sequential Ordering Problem. The results that I achieved suggest that I succeded in that task. Few months later I wrote an article about my findings, but it was not accepted for publishing - and it took them a while to inform me about this. Here you can find the article I wrote and my implementation of the EACS2 test program. I know that some parts of it are not the best quality (especially the GUI and threading handling), but when I wrote it there was a time pressure.

I'd be glad if anyone could benefit from the effort I put into this. If you find something that could be fixed, or that would render my findings invalid, please feel free to get in touch. I don't plan any further work on the subject.
